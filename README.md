##Project Proposal - PourTaste
With no experience as Sommeliers or Oenophiles, we would like to study wine data.    Our project is to examine relationships between wine prices compared to reviews, region, province, ratings, and variety.  Finally, we would like to answer the question whether it is possible to get high rated wines for less than $15 a bottle.
